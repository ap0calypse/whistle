Usage:
------

whistle must be started within a fully functional terminal.

The first step is to add a music directory with 'A'. The standard
usage scenario then is to select what you want to play and press 'P'.



About:
------

whistle aims to be a very minimalistic and basic mp3 player.

Basically, whistle is a nifty front-end to mpg123, which it's
based on. Without mpg123, there would be no whistle.
