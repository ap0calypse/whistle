README - whistle

Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl Modules:
    
        - MP3::Info     (archlinux-package: perl-mp3-info)
        - Curses::UI    (archlinux-package: perl-curses-ui)

Programs:

        - mpg123


What works?
-----------

        - full MP3 play/stop/next/prev/seek/shuffle support
        - playlists 


What's to come?
---------------

        - a lot of bugfixes for sure
        - mp3 tag write support
        - (equalizer?)
        - ...
        - your feature request?


Usage:
------

whistle must be started within a fully functional terminal.

The first step is to add a music directory with 'A'. The standard
usage scenario then is to select what you want to play and press 'P'.



About:
------

whistle aims to be a very minimalistic and basic mp3 player.

Basically, whistle is a nifty front-end to mpg123, which it's
based on. Without mpg123, there would be no whistle.
